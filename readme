SandR is a Windows Search and Replace tool.  It is very dangerous & could cause you grief if you are stupid about it.
It will search & replace any text specified in the 2 arguments that are passed to it within the current directory.

Example:

I want to replace all occurrances of "Dog" with "Cat", I would simply do:

C:\>sandr Dog Cat

That's it!  SandR is case sensitive.
